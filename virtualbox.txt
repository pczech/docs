Uninstalling VirtualBox
-----------------------
sudo apt-get purge virtualbox-/*


Installing VirtualBox
---------------------
Install dkms package, otherwise kernel modules will need to be recreated
manually whenever the kernel is updated using the command
/etc/init.d/vboxadd setup as root.
 
Download .deb package from http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/4.3.12/
sudo dpkg - i virtualbox.deb or double click .deb file and it shall be opened
by Ubuntu Software Center.

A guest system installation ISO image can be mounted directly to CD/DVD drive:
Settings -> Storage -> IDE -> Empty -> [CD Menu icon] -> 
  Choose a virtual CD/DVD disk file.

  
Installing Guest Additions
--------------------------
.iso file should be installed by above .deb package in /usr/share/virtualbox
G: Install dkms package (see above).
G: select Menu->Devices->Insert Guest Addition CD...


USB
---
Install VirtualBox Extension Pack to enable USB 2.0
(USB 2.0 may be required for some devices).
Add your user to vboxusers group: sudo adduser <USER> vboxusers
(to remove: sudo deluser <USER> vboxusers).
Logout and login to get the groups permissions from /etc/group
Add a filter for the given USB device in Virtual Machine settings to
automatically mount the USB device and then run the virtual machine or run the
virtual machine and then select the device from Menu Devices -> USB Devices.


Shared folders
--------------
Required: Guest Additions
H: Create a folder <FOLDER> to be used as the shared folder
G: Add the folder to Shared Folders (e.g. with options Read-only, Auto-mount)
G: Restart the system
G: Now the shared folder should be mounted automatically as /media/sf_<FOLDER>,
   but it is not accessible by default. See the note: "Access to auto-mounted
   shared folders is only granted to the user group vboxsf, which is created
   by the VirtualBox Guest Additions installer. Hence guest users have to be
   member of that group to have read/write access or to have read-only access
   in case the folder is not mapped writable."
G: add user to vboxsf group: sudo adduser <USER> vboxsf
G: Logout and login (see USB issue above)

Resize virtual disk
-------------------
If resizing doesn't work for your disk format (e.g. fixed size disks), clone the
disk to the proper format first:

VBoxManage clonehd <INFILENAME> <OUTFILENAME> --format vdi --variant standard 

Resize the disk:

VBoxManage modifyhd <FILENAME> --resize <SIZE MB> e.g. 65536 for 64GB

If you cloned the drive, replace the drive file for the guest

Use a partition management tool inside the guest to adjust the main partition
to fill the drive.

Download Gparted Live CD:

Mount the iso to Guest system CD drive and run the system from CD
