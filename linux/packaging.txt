apt-get
-------
APT was originally designed as a front-end for dpkg to work with Debian's .deb
packages, but it has since been modified to also work with the RPM Package
Manager system via APT-RPM.

install <package>
    Download <package> and all of its dependencies, and installs or upgrades
    them.
    
update
    Resynchronize the package index files from their sources to get information
    on the newest versions of packages and their dependencies. The lists of
    available packages are fetched from the location(s) specified in
    /etc/apt/sources.list.   
    
remove <package>
    TODO

purge
    Purge is identical to remove except that packages are removed and purged
    (any configuration files are deleted too). 

autoclean
    Removes .deb files for packages that are no longer installed on your
    system. Depending on your installation habits, removing these files from
    /var/cache/apt/archives may regain a significant amount of diskspace.

clean
    The same as autoclean, except it removes all packages from the package
    cache. This may not be desirable if you have a slow Internet connection,
    since it will cause you to redownload any packages you need to install
    a program.


Examples:
sudo apt-get purge virtualbox-\*


Reserve dependencies (why is the package installed) 
apt-cache rdepends [--reverse] <package>


*******************************************************************************
dpkg
----
Package manager for Debian based systems. It can install, remove, and build
packages, but unlike other package management system's it can not automatically
download and install packages and their dependencies.

-i <package>
     Install a Debian package file (only this Deb package, and will notify you 
     of any dependencies that need to be installed, but it will not install
     them).

-l [<pattern>]
    List all packages installed on the system, for example:
    dpkg -l | grep apache2
              
-S <file>
    Show package which installed a file
              
dpkg flags
----------
dpkg -l | head -3

First letter -> expected package state:
    u - unknown
    i - install
    r - remove/deinstall
    p - purge (remove including config files)
    h - hold

Second letter -> current package state:
    n - not-installed
    i - installed
    c - config-files (only the config files are installed)
    u - unpacked
    f - half-configured (configuration failed for some reason)
    h - half-installed (installation failed for some reason)
    w - triggers-awaited (package is waiting for a trigger from another package)
    t - triggers-pending (package has been triggered)

Third letter -> error state (you normally shouldn't see a thrid letter):
    r - reinst-required (package broken, reinstallation required)

Examples:    
ii  - It should be installed and it is installed
rc  - It's removed/uninstalled but it's configuration files are still there
