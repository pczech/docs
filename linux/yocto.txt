cd poky
source oe-init-build-env
        Environment setup script defines OpenEmbedded build environment
        settings needed to complete the build. The script also creates
        the Build Directory, which is 'build' is located in the Source
        Directory. After the script runs, your current working directory
        is set to the Build Directory. Later, when the build completes,
        the Build Directory contains all the files created during the build.
        
        Source Directory: the directory structure created as a result of
        creating a local copy of the poky Git or expanding a released poky
        tarball. The Source Directory contains BitBake, Documentation, Metadata
        and other files that all support the Yocto Project. Consequently, you 
        must have the Source Directory in place on your development system in
        order to do any development using the Yocto Project.
        
        Build Directory: the area used by the OpenEmbedded build system for
        builds. The area is created when you source the setup environment
        script that is found in the Source Directory (i.e. oe-init-build-env
        or oe-init-build-env-memres).
