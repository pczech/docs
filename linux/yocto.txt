Configuration
-------------
http://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/current/ref-manual/ref-manual.html#user-configuration

cd poky
source oe-init-build-env [<build_dir>]
        Environment setup script defines OpenEmbedded build environment
        settings needed to complete the build. The script also creates the
        Build Directory <build_dir>, which is 'build' by default and is located
        in the Source Directory.
        
Environment variables:
PATH=./poky/scripts:./poky/bitbake/bin/
BUILDDIR=./poky/build
BB_ENV_EXTRAWHITE=(...)

The 'meta-yocto' layer inside Poky contains a conf directory that has example
configuration files. The script creates conf directory in the Build Directory
that contains default versions of your local.conf and bblayers.conf
configuration files. These default configuration files are created only if
versions do not already exist in the Build Directory at the time you source the
build environment setup script.

The setup script calls the script scripts/oe-setup-builddir, that sets up the
Build Directory and seeds the directory (if necessary) with configuration files
appropriate for the development environment.

The scripts/oe-setup-builddir script uses the $TEMPLATECONF variable to
determine which sample configuration files to locate. 

The ./poky/build/conf/local.conf file provides many basic variables that define
a build environment: 

BB_NUMBER_THREADS
    number of tasks bitbake should run in parallel

PARALLEL_MAKE
    how many processes make should run in parallel when running compile tasks
    
MACHINE
    machine selection (qemuarm, qemux86, ...)
    
For more details see .poky/build/conf/local.conf
    

Build Directory structure
/build
/build/downloads        DL_DIR          downloaded tarballs storage
/build/sstate-cache     SSTATE_DIR      shared-state files storage
/build/tmp              TMPDIR          build output
