Device Tree

Before
The kernel contains the entire description of the hardware. The bootloader
loads a single binary, the kernel image, and executes it.

With Device Tree
The kernel no longer contains the description of the hardware, it is located
in a separate binary: the Device Tree Blob. The bootloader loads two binaries:
the kernel image and the DTB. DTB is located in kernel's arch/arm/boot/dts
folder, one per board.
