Issue: menu links not translated if default language is changed.

Translating Menus

Issue 1
-------
Menu links generated by Views (contributed modules) cannot be translated -
when 'translate' is selected in admin/structure/menu/manage/main-menu for a
given link, then 'This object has no strings available for translation.' is
shown. The string is also not available in admin/config/regional/translate/
translate.
https://drupal.org/node/1914996

Solution 1.
The menu links are in neutral language by default. Set a language for the link
in admin/structure/menu/manage/main-menu, and then it can be translated.
However for every language, a new menu link is created. For many languages and
menu links, it can be hard to maintain.

Solution 2.
Override Menu link titles. Set 'internal' menu title in View and change its
name in admin/structure/menu/manage/main-menu. Then select 'translate' link
and provide translations. Here menu links are not multiplied.

Don't set specific weights in Views for the menu links as they are customized
and ordered in admin/structure/menu/manage/main-menu anyhow.
-----

Menu link descriptions (shown when hovering over the menu link) are translated
in the same way like links (solution 2).

Views 2nd level menu links (tabs).
The links are visible in admin/config/regional/translate/translate and can be
translated there (see Issue 2).

Issue 2
-------
Fatal error: Call to a member function cache_reset() on a non-object in
sites/all/modules/i18n/i18n_string/i18n_string.pages.inc.

TODO
Translating User Menu

For the menu links defined by Menu (e.g. Register/Log in/Log out), leave
neutral language and use Translate interface to avoid multiple menu links.

Menu links to user/login (Log in), user/logout (Log out)

Sign out(custom)    user/logout         User            OK                      OK

Conclusion:
- Menus links provided by modules cannot be translated.
- Those menu links can be translated if customized in Menu, however the link
  title must be changed to avoid collisions with other existing menu links
  (also for new menu link added by user like 'Log in').
