 gzip -c db.sql > db.sql.gz

 /.htaccess - patch to protect original original images
 /modules/node/node.module - TODO

 After unpacking the archive check the git status. Many files seems to be
 modified locally (check git status). Take the HEAD version from (local)
 repository by 'git checkout -- *' command and then import to Eclipse.
