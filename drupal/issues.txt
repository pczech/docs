Clean URL bug
-------------
Scenario:
Disable Clean URL (before site migration, for example)
Enable Clean URl again. Clean URL test fails then.

Backup and migrate a site
-------------------------
https://drupal.org/node/679054
gzip -c db.sql > db.sql.gz


Update core
-----------
https://drupal.org/node/1494290

Make a copy of the production site. See 'Backup and migrate a site'.
Verify the copy - install the copy on development sever and check if the site
works correctly.
 
Update the core on the test site first to check if works correctly.

Compare site to be upgraded with the same original core, to identify private
patches. Currently they are:
/.htaccess - patch to protect original original images
/modules/node/node.module

Delete all the files & folders inside your original Drupal instance except for
/sites folder and any custom files you added elsewhere.

Copy all the folders and files except /sites from inside the extracted Drupal
package into your original Drupal instance.

Apply custom changes to core files.

Login as user 1 and run update.php by navigating to http://<site>/update.php


pde.zip (Programming Drupal 7 Entities)
---------------------------------------
Issue: many files modified, permission denied blocks branch checkouts.

After unpacking the archive many files seems to be modified locally
(check git status). Take the HEAD version from (local) repository by 
'git checkout -- *' command and then import to Eclipse.

It doesn't solve the problem. See the comment below.

Create a bare clone of the repository in local repository storage, e.g.
~/git/pde.git: git clone --bare <PDE> ~/git/pde.git
Import the project to Eclipse using URI and 'Local File' method.
Rename sites/default/settings.php to e.g. settings.php.org.
Install pde drupal with a fresh, empty database.
Update .gitignore to ignore Eclipse files
Commit the changes
(!) Before branch checkout, make sites/default folder and settings.php file
writable.
Update settings.php and .gitignore for every branch
