    Select:     coder - main entry point to coder functionality. Called if no
                options are given to the coder path, then you can select what
                to review and run the reviews. If the path coder/review/MODULE
                is used, then it sets the module in SELECT SPECIFIC MODULES
                options and runs the review - this is used by 'Review code'
                link in Modules menu. Sets also 'include files' in WHAT TO
                REVIEW.

    All:        coder/review/all - review all modules (selects all modules
                available in SELECT SPECIFIC MODULES, SELECT SPECIFIC THEMES).

                the review.

                run the review.

             SPECIFIC THEMES.

 Ignore system
 If coder is throwing annoying warnings, you can tell coder to ignore the warning
 in your code using the comment:
 
 // @ignore RULE_NAME:SCOPE
 
 RULE_NAME: e.g. sniffer_commenting_inlinecomment_spacingafter
 SCOPE: file class | function | comment | number of lines
    
      
 Issues
 
 Issue 01
 No result on pressing 'Default'
 See /var/log/apache2/error.log:
 PHP Fatal error:  Maximum execution time of 30 seconds exceeded in ...
 
 Solution
 increase max_execution_time in /etc/php5/cgi/php.ini (if fcgi is used)
 restart apache: service apache2 restart
 
 Issue 02
 No result on reviewing a module
 See /var/log/apache2/error.log
 PHP Fatal error:  Call to undefined method
 Coder requires PHP_CodeSniffer module:
 pear install PHP_CodeSniffer
 
 Solution
 7.x-2.0+14-dev (dev01 + pdd) works with PHP_CodeSniffer-1.4.7
 pear uninstall PHP_CodeSniffer
 pear install PHP_CodeSniffer-1.4.7
 try `pear upgrade` if `pear install` doesn't work.

 7.x-2.1+1-dev (dev03 + det) doesn't work with 1.4.7 and 1.5.0
 Install 1.5.0 and apply patch #4 from https://drupal.org/node/2146275
 See Issue 04, PHP_CodeSniffer-1.4.6 is OK even for 7.x-2.1+4-dev
 
 Issue 03
 7.x-2.1+1-dev seems not to work well. 7.x-2.0+17-dev reports much more issues
 
 Solution
 7.x-2.1+2-dev works fine with PHP_CodeSniffer 1.4.6, PEAR 1.9.4, UBUNTU 12.04?
 See Issue 04
 
 Issue 04
 Installation process.
 https://drupal.org/node/1419988
 (!) Add the Drupal coding standards definitions included with Coder to
 PHP_CodeSniffer's standards library:
 sudo ln -sv /path/to/coder/coder_sniffer/Drupal 
    $(pear config-get php_dir)/PHP/CodeSniffer/Standards/Drupal
    
 Solution
 When working with multiple installations like dev01, dev02, dev03, you should
 update the symbolic link to current working directory. Please always install
 the latest dev. version of Coder, if you need to go back and work with older
 installation, please update the Coder module there.
 Current working configuration: PHP_CodeSniffer-1.4.7 Coder 7.x-2.1+4-dev.
 
 
 Devel
 -----
 Supports dpm()
 
 
 Schema
 ------
 You should rarely have to write a schema from scratch. Going to Structure ->
 Schema will give you the ability to see a schema definition for any database
 table by clicking the Inspect tab. So you can get the schema definition by
 using the schema module, and then copy and paste it into your .install file.
