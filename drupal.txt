 See /var/log/apache2/error.log
 PHP Fatal error:  Call to undefined method
 Coder requires PHP_CodeSniffer module:
 pear install PHP_CodeSniffer
 
 Solution
 7.x-2.0+14-dev (dev01 + pdd) works with PHP_CodeSniffer-1.4.7
 pear uninstall PHP_CodeSniffer
 pear install PHP_CodeSniffer-1.4.7
 try `pear upgrade` if `pear install` doesn't work.

 7.x-2.1+1-dev (dev03 + det) doesn't work with 1.4.7 and 1.5.0
 Install 1.5.0 and apply patch #4 from https://drupal.org/node/2146275 

 
 Devel

 Supports dpm()
 
 
 Schema
 ------
 You should rarely have to write a schema from scratch. Going to Structure ->
 Schema will give you the ability to see a schema definition for any database
 table by clicking the Inspect tab. So you can get the schema definition by
 using the schema module, and then copy and paste it into your .install file.
