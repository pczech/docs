 Devel

 Supports dpm()
 
 
 Schema
 ------
 You should rarely have to write a schema from scratch. Going to Structure -> Schema will give you
 the ability to see a schema definition for any database table by clicking the Inspect tab. So you
 can get the schema definition by using the schema module, and then copy and paste it into your
 .install file.
